`wayne` is an experimental implementation of the wayland server protocol entirely in rust. It does not attempt to mirror the `libwayland` api, but rather re-imagine the api in a way that works best with rusty patterns and norms. This also means a departure from the controversial `libwayland` provided event loop, providing a more versitile bring your own event loop architecture instead.
